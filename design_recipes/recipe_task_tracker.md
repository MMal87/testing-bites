1.Describe the problem

As a user
So that I can keep track of my tasks
I want a program that I can add todo tasks to and see a list of them.

As a user
So that I can focus on tasks to complete
I want to mark tasks as complete and have them disappear from the list.

Don't worry about user input & output here.

2. Design the class interface

class Tracker:
    User facing properties:
    task_list: list

    def __init__(self, task_list):
        Parameters: 
        task_list: a list

        # Side effects:
        #   Sets the task_list property of the class
        pass # No code here yet

    def add_tasks(self):
        Parameters:
        task_list: a list to add tasks to
        side effects:
        adds to a list
    def imcomplete_tasks():

    
    def mark_tasks_complete(self, index):
        parameters:
        self._task_list
